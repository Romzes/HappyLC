# Medium 198. House Robber
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
# Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
# the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected
# and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
# return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
