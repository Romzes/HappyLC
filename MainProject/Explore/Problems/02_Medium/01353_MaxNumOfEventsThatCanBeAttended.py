# Medium 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
# You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
# You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.
# Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
