# You are given the root of a binary tree.
# A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:
#   Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
#   If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
#   Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
#   Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.
# Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).
# Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
