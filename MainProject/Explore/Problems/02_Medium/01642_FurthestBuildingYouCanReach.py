"""
1642 (Medium) Furthest Building You Can Reach
You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.
You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.
While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),
  If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
  If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
Constraints:
  1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
  1 <= heights[i] <= 10^6
  0 <= bricks <= 10^9
  0 <= ladders <= heights.length
